## 📝 Introduction

This repository documents my personal journey of mastering TypeScript. It includes exercises, challenges, and projects that progressively build upon each other, starting from the basics and advancing to real-world applications.

## 🧭 Learning Stages

### 🟢 Stage 1 – Fundamentals

- [x] Primitive Types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol
- [ ] Type Inference
- [ ] Manual Type Annotations
- [ ] Functions with Parameter and Return Types
- [ ] Arrays and Tuples
- [ ] Enums
- [ ] Typed Objects
- [ ] Union Types (A | B)
- [ ] Intersection Types (A & B)
- [ ] Literal Types ('admin' | 'user')
- [ ] Type Aliases and Interfaces
- [ ] Optional and Readonly Properties

### 🟡 Stage 2 – Control and Safety

- [ ] Type Narrowing
- [ ] Type Guards (in, typeof, instanceof)
- [ ] Type Predicates (x is Type)
- [ ] Discriminated Unions
- [ ] Null Safety (?, !, ??, ??=)
- [ ] Type Assertions (as)
- [ ] Conditional Structures with Safe Types
- [ ] Functions that Never Return (never)

### 🟠 Stage 3 – Structure and Modularization

- [ ] Modules (import/export with types)
- [ ] Namespaces (and why they're rarely used)
- [ ] Composition of Interfaces and Types
- [ ] Deep Dive into Interface vs Type
- [ ] Basic Generics (<T>)
- [ ] Generic Functions and Structures
- [ ] Type Constraints (<T extends ...>)
- [ ] Utility Types: Partial, Pick, Omit, Record, Exclude, etc.

### 🔵 Stage 4 – Advanced and Powerful

- [ ] Mapped Types
- [ ] Conditional Types (T extends U ? X : Y)
- [ ] Template Literal Types
- [ ] The `infer` Keyword
- [ ] Declaring Recursive Types
- [ ] Function Overloads
- [ ] Defining Types from Values
- [ ] Advanced Type Inference Manipulation
- [ ] Advanced tsconfig.json Configuration

### 🟣 Stage 5 – TypeScript in the Real World

- [ ] TypeScript with Node.js
- [ ] TypeScript with React (or another framework)
- [ ] Working with External Libraries (@types/)
- [ ] Writing Your Own Types for Libraries
- [ ] API Integration (typing responses and requests)
- [ ] Monorepos and Large Projects with TypeScript
- [ ] Type-Checking in CI/CD
